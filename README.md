How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

How does creating “user stories” help with this?

 Well like most things i do i will frist take everything i have been given look over it to see what need to be done to start. But before i start codeing i will ask some quiests. about what they are trying to do with this progarms so i can see a biger pitures. Once i see that i will plan to leave some things open for add ons later so the next person will not have to do to munch more work. 
What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To be honestly i am really not to sure yet since i know what i have learns is very good. but out in the working world i know it can all be thrown out the window in sec. i know some companies do not follow what has been put out their to use or they just do not use it right all together.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me being a good team member is nowaday at any job you go to almost but not really inforced . But in software development being a good team player is a must  otherwise the team will fall apart. Then the people who are working will not get done as fast and the quality will fall since we will have other people on the team working longer hours which in turn can hurt their work and will be making more mistakes.
