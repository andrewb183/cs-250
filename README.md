How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
the user knows what they want but not want is needed to make it happen and some time the need and implements that have to be made to the program can have two very different time frames to get done. For example what the user needs could be simple but to implement could take a longer amount of time to test  and make sure their are not any problems that could happen from the changes that you made,
How does creating “user stories” help with this?
by making user stories  it help you break down what it is that you have to do and were the priority lay on what you have to get down. like sometimes the user story could be big but be a low priority and some could be small but high priority.

 Well like most things i do i will frist take everything i have been given look over it to see what need to be done to start. But before i start codeing i will ask some quiests. about what they are trying to do with this progarms so i can see a biger pitures. Once i see that i will plan to leave some things open for add ons later so the next person will not have to do to munch more work. 
What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To be honestly i am really not to sure yet since i know what i have learns is very good. but out in the working world i know it can all be thrown out the window in sec. i know some companies do not follow what has been put out their to use or they just do not use it right all together.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me being a good team member is nowaday at any job you go to almost but not really inforced . But in software development being a good team player is a must  otherwise the team will fall apart. Then the people who are working will not get done as fast and the quality will fall since we will have other people on the team working longer hours which in turn can hurt their work and will be making more mistakes.
